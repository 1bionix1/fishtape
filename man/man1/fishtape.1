.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIFishtape\fR is a TAP (Test Anything Protocol) producer and test harness for fish\. It scans one or more \fB\.fish\fR files and evaluate test blocks producing a TAP stream\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pipe\fR=\fIutility\fR
Pipe line buffered output into the given \fIutility\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Show version information\.
.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show help information\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Test files are \fB\.fish\fR files with one or more test blocks\. A test block consists of an optional description and any test expression supported by \fBtest\fR(1)\.

.SH "SETUP AND TEARDOWN"
.
.TP
\fBsetup\fR
Run before each test in the current file\. Use \fBsetup\fR to load fixtures and/or set up your environment\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

set \-l path $DIRNAME/$TESTNAME

function setup
    mkdir \-p $path
end

.
.TP
\fBteardown\fR
Run after each test in the current file\. Use \fBteardown\fR to clean up loaded resources, etc\.
.
.IP "" 4

function \-S teardown
    rm \-rf $path
end

.
.SH "VARIABLES"
The following variables are available inside a test file:
.
.TP
\fB$FILENAME\fR
Path to the running script\.
.
.TP
\fB$DIRNAME\fR
Directory name of the running script\.
.
.TP
\fB$TEST\fR
Name of the running script\.
.
.TP
\fB$TAP_VERSION\fR
TAP protocol version\.
.
.SH "METHODS"
The following methods are available inside a test file:
.
.TP
\fBcomment\fR [\fImessage\fR]
Print a message without breaking the tap output\. This is a wrapper for \fBprintf "# %s\en" >&2\fR\.
.
.SH "BUGS"
.
.SS "Line Buffered Output"
According to <github\.com/fish\-shell/fish\-shell/issues/1396> redirections and pipes involving blocks are run serially, not in parallel\. This causes \fBfishtape\fR to block the pipeline and buffer all of its output\. To emit a line buffered stream use \fB\-\-pipe\fR=\fIprogram\fR\.

.IP "\(bu" 4
Only one expression per test block is allowed\. Use command substitutions to create more complex test expressions\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Each test file is wrapped in \fBbegin; end\fR blocks behind the scenes to protect your local scope\. Also, after each test, global variables are restored to their initial value at the time of running \fBfishtape\fR\.
